<h2>Week 6 Group Setup</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week, our team completed the initial setup for our group project, making sure that we set up our Slack channel for team communication, Trello board for project planning, and our GitHub repository using the GitHub classroom link provided in the assignment details. We completed our group agreement on Trello, which outlines team member names and emails, and shared team expectations such as our preferred communication methods, meeting arrangements, missed meeting protocol, how we deal with problems, and skills assesment. I have also added my teammates on LinkedIn in preparation for our final LinkedIn report.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent approximately 2 hours setting up the tools and completing the group agreement, and an additional 3 hours on content this week.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>Setting up the necessary collaboration tools is essential for our assignment, ensuring that our teamwork is as effective as possible. The integration of Slack with GitHub and Trello ensures good communication and constant updates as we progress through this project. I can say I gained a better understanding on how Trello helps teams with project planning, containing areas on the board like our project management details, inbox, next actions, ideas, and done, which will be beneficial for my team as we move forward with the assignment.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>Working through this week's group setup has made me realise the importance of having a well structured team collaboration and how important this is for workplaces. These tools allow teams to work efficienty through project stages, making sure that everyone stays informed and up to date with project progress. Our team decided to individually research and test different hosting platforms. Next week we will come together and compare our findings at the practical to select the most suitable option for our website. This research approach will not only help us understand the pros and cons of different hosting options, but can also be used in workplaces to ensure we make an informed decision for what we may be doing(for us it is our project.)</p>
