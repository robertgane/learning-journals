<h2>Week 3 - WordPress CMS & Group Interviews</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week, I focused on setting up my WordPress site for my startup hosted on AWS Lightsail (Same as my joomla site). I also participated in a group formation exercise that involved conducting round-robin style interviews with classmates to identify potential group members for our major project.(assignment 2 in cp3402)</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 3-4 hours for the Wordpress setup and 2 hours in the practical for the interviews</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>WordPress is easier to use than Joomla, with a more user-friendly design, it made setting up the site much simpler. I learned that child themes help customize a website without losing updates, which is useful for making small changes, and made me understand why we dont go straight to customising the parent theme as if an update was available, all my changes will get wiped which is not the case for child themes.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>I asked my classmates the following questions based on working style, availability, diligence, and their shared expectations.
  
How do you prefer to structure your workday?
Do you work best independently or in collaboration with others?
When working in a team. What is your preferred method of communication?
How do you prioritize tasks when multiple deadlines are approaching?
What do you expect from a team to help you succeed?
What type of work environment helps you thrive? 

Conducting the interviews with some of my classmates helped me learn more about their different working styles, availability, and expectations. I found that people prioritize tasks differently, with some focusing on deadlines while others look at the importance of the task. Communication preferences also varied, with most favoring Discord, WhatsApp, and email. These insights will help in forming an effective group for our project.

Overall, this week helped me understand WordPress better and gave me useful insights on working in a team for our second assignment.</p>
