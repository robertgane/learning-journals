<h2>Week 5 - WordPress Child Theme</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week I focused on creating a WordPress child theme using my WordPress site I made in Local by Flywheel for last weeks practical. I made changes to my websites appearance including: Colours, Font, Text, Padding, and other changes. After watching the LinkedIn Learning videos on child themes, I created my own child theme, and was able to view files in Atom (a code editor by GitHub). I also created a LinkedIn post on one lesson I have learned so far in this subject (CP3402).</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 4 hours for this weeks practical.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>This week I gained a much deeper understanding of how WordPress themes work. I learned how to correctly set up the child themes folder, create the necessary files (functions.php and style.css) to go into this folder, and correctly follow the child theme handbook on child themes by WordPress to make sure my code meets the standards. I really found the inspect element tool in the browser a great way select the element I want to customise and copy it to my css. As I worked in my local development environment, I encountered my first look at php code, which of course was not the focus of this weeks practical but I feel is beneficial for me to briefly understand some of what is happening in php files for later weeks as we will need to know more about this for the group assignment.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>Having the set of skills to understand how to create and customise child themes in WorPress is essential for website developers. It can help save time and money if there is no internet access, as developers can keep working on thier site in a local development environment, while reducing cost on hosting the website. I would like to know more about child themes including modifications to the templates and appearence, and php code in the next few weeks.</p>
