<h2>Week 1 - Basic Web Design</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>For this weeks practical I made a simple website for my startup company that contained three pages, the home, team, and contact pages. I had to provide enough information so people who are new to my website can understand my startup. I watched the linkedIn videos for this week and I also found W3 Schools was a great resource in understanding html and css code that I used in my website. I used Visual Studio Code and when my simple website was finished I published it online using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> by following the simple step by step guide.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 2-3 hours altogether to watch the linkedIn videos and roughly 5 hours all up on creating my website.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>After reviewing this weeks content I was able to understand why planning and prototyping tools are important for user experience and design, the basics of html, css, and javascript, and explored and compared a few available web hosts but settled on GitHub Pages when completing the practical.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>Having the skills to understand html, css, and javascript and be able to build a basic website and publish it online is a must have to becoming a website developer or being employed by a company requiring this. After this week I found an interest for designing the frontend of my simple website so I might explore UX and UI design in the future.</p>
