<h2>Week 1 - Basic Web Design</h2>
<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>For this weeks practical I made a simple website for my startup company that contained three pages, the home, team, and contact pages. I had to provide enough information so people who are new to my website can understand my startup. I watched the linkedIn videos for this week which helped me revise the basics of html and css and therefore provided me with enough of an understanding on how to get started. I also found W3 Schools was a great resource in understanding html and css code that I used in my website. I used Visual Studio Code and when my simple website was finished I published it online using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> by following the simple step by step guide.</p>
Your task in the first prac is to make a very simple website for your startup business for assignment 1 and publish it online (submit the URL). The site should have at least 3 pages (or sections for a single-page design) and contain enough content that a reasonable person would understand your startup business; including text and images.
<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 2-3 hours altogether to watch the linkedIn videos and roughly 5 hours all up on creating my website.</p>
