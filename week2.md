<h2>Week 2 - Joomla CMS</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week I started working on the Joomla CMS part of Assignment 1. To differentiate my site from the default Joomla installation, I customized the default template, changing the structure and colours, along with added pages, text, and images that align with my startup’s audience. This helped me gain hands on experience in modifying Joomla site templates and has helped me structure website content more effectively.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 5-6 hours altogether to watch the linkedIn learning videos and other videos that helped me in Joomla. Not including time spent on the assignment itself.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>I Customised Joomla's default templates provided valuable insight into how Joomla is different from other CMS platforms like WordPress. I was new to the structure of how to make customisations to the template, fortunately there were videos that helped me understand the order of how you should go about things in Joomla like creating pages and adding site modules. I also explored Joomla’s extensions, which could be beneficial for future functionality enhancements. I was able to add a map into my joomla website using an extensing called smile pack, which is a module that you can later add onto the page you want it on. This week also reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS, as modifying templates required adjusting styles and layout properties.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>Starting this assignment has given me a better understanding of Joomla’s potential in website development. While WordPress remains more widely used and recognised, learning Joomla has improved my skill & experience and therefore makes me more adaptable to different CMS platforms, which could be valuable for future projects or employment opportunities. I also found that my method of learning is to initially learn the weeks content, attempt the practicals, but then I loop between watching and reading guides and improving my website. This method helped me complete this practical and I can see this method or work flow being used in the working field.</p>
