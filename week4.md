<h2>Week 4 - Development and deployment workflows</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week, I focused on setting up a local development environment. I used Local by Flywheel to create and install WordPress locally, which allows me to develop and test my site without needing to be connected to the internet, and not risk working directly on the production server. I also learned about version control and how it can be used for developing a site in a team, using sites like github to pull, push and commit changes to a shared site.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent around 3 hours this week</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>Local by Flywheel was easy to set up, and I found it to be an ideal option for setting up WordPress locally. I learned that it was important to configure settings like the database correctly to ensure that the site works properly, althought this was again made simple as I used the preferred recommendations to configure the database. I also gained a better understanding of the WordPress files by looking through the files, accessible in VS-Code, which will be helpful for creating and customizing child-themes in the future.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>Using Local by Flywheel helped me understand the importance of a local development environment setup in web development. This approach allows for safer testing before deploying changes to the live site. I also realized that increasing my understanding of deployment strategies is valuable for web development roles, as it ensures that sites are properly maintained and updated without the worries of something being broken on the live site. I understand the significance of version control for tracking changes and collaborating on projects, which can improve teamwork and project efficiency. I will continue to use this workflow for the upcoming assignment, practicals and other websites I may develop as its best practice for possible employment in the future.</p>
