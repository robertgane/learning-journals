<h2>Week 8 Learning Experiments</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>Hypothesis - This week, I conducted a learning experiment to determine a hypothesis I have about a learning activity with which I chose to comparing the Pomodoro technique with continuous studying to prove whether one method is better at keeping me focused than the other. Basically, the Pomodoro technique is 25 minutes of study, and 5 minutes to have a break, then repeat, whereas continuous study is longer periods of study with limited breaks.</p>
<p>Test -  As I continued learning PHP code I decided to study for 4 hours all up, 2 hours dedicated to using each method. This means that the continuous method will be for 2 hours straight, and the Pomodoro method will be 4 x 25 minute study, 4 x 5 minute breaks = 2 hours. This will be measured by my levels of focus and possible feelings of fatigue. I find these results are beneficial to me as someone else would have to conduct their own test for their own benefit.</p>
<p>Results - I found that continuously studying started off strong as I felt focused and engaged, after 40-45 minutes my levels of focus started to drop and I found I needed a break after just an hour. As for the Pomodoro technique I was able to focus through each 25 minute period because of the breaks that allowed my brain to essentially recalibrate and not feel any signs of fatigue whatsoever. I can determine that the Pomodoro technique was a better aproach for studying then Continuously studying as I was able to effectively study for longer a much longer period with little to no decline in my level to focus.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>2 hours for the Pomodoro technique, 2 hours for continuous study = 4 hours in total.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>This week, I increased my understanding of PHP making sure that I know the structure and syntax of the different concepts. Still practicing these concepts using the linkedIn Learning videos on PHP from week 7 helped reinforce my understanding, along with other videos that I also found helpful. Additionally, include statements proved useful in structuring code efficiently by separating reusable components like headers and footers, and it made the overall structure of the different PHP pages look neat and understandable.</p>
