<h2>Week 10 Presentation Rehearsals</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>For this final week, my team were given the task to create a presentation video for part of our assignment. The presentation had to demonstrate and justify our chosen development and deployment workflow, considering best-practice issues such as project management, version control, testing, and automation.</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>To create the powerpoint and scripts took 2-3 hours, and the time to create my final video submission was about 1 hour.</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>I took two takes to video my part in the presentation, which was the live demonstration. In my first take, I noticed that I stuttered in areas of my script that I possibly didn't practice verbally speaking before pressing the record button. Another issue was my camera background, to fix this I moved to face the camera to a plain white wall in my house and began my second take. After reviewing my second take, I was happy with the results and it only required a little editing to help with the flow of the presentation.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>I understand that there might come a time in my career where I will have to give a presentation on something in the future, which is why this week imparticular was the most challenging and rewarding for me. The challenging part for me is working in a teams, but I was able to overcome this challenge by attending the stand-up meeting. This helped a lot as my team and I were able to discuss where we are at, what problems we had, resolutions to these problems, and what to do next in the project. Overall I am happy that I was able to turn what was once an uncomfortable envirnment into an everyday normal environment which is also what I would think that an employers would expect from me. To not be scared to give something a go.</p>
