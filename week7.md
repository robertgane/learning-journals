<h2>Week 7 PHP</h2>

<h3>Learning Activities & Resources</h3>
<p>This week I worked on writing and running PHP code to demonstrate it in my browser locally. I created a simple website with a few pages that shared a common header and footer using include. I also used echo to output different html code, implemented if/else statements, used for loop, while loop, and iterated over an array using foreach loop, and created and used a function with parameters(both default value and passing in something as a parameter).</p>

<h3>Estimated Hours</h3>
<p>I spent about 5 hours watching the LinkedIn Learning videos, and an additional 4-5 working on this weeks practical</p>

<h3>Content Insights</h3>
<p>Writing PHP from scratch helped reinforce my understanding of the PHP programming language. Using echo to output html made me realize how easy and flexible PHP is and how it can still work with html code. The if/else statements were useful for handling conditional logic, such as displaying different messages based input. While and for loops were able to maintain the loops until it met a certain condition then would break, as well as for each loops that would help iterate through each item in an array. Finally,using include for a common header and footer made the site more structurally friendly both with how it appeared on the browser and in vs code, which I found is a valuable practice in real-world development.</p>

<h3>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h3>
<p>This practical strengthened my understanding of PHP, which is widely used in WordPress development. Learning how to structure a website with reusable components (like headers and footers) is a best practice in web development. Additionally, working with functions and loops made me more comfortable with PHP syntax, reinforcing my programming skills. In the future I plan to apply these concepts in my group project, as PHP will likely be useful for handling parts of my website such as headers, footers, login system, ect.</p>
